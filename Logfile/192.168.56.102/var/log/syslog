Mar 16 10:54:27 Server1 pulseaudio[1565]: ALSA woke us up to write new data to the device, but there was actually nothing to write.
Mar 16 10:54:27 Server1 pulseaudio[1565]: Most likely this is a bug in the ALSA driver 'snd_intel8x0'. Please report this issue to the ALSA developers.
Mar 16 10:54:27 Server1 pulseaudio[1565]: We were woken up with POLLOUT set -- however a subsequent snd_pcm_avail() returned 0 or another value < min_avail.
